# codersunitewebpage
A website for Coders Unite at Minnetonka Middle School East

## What does it do?
Our goals for the project are that it advertises the Coder's club, that it displays profiles on the members who wish to share their information, and that it acts as a group portfolio for our work. 

## You're not going to use GitHub Pages always, are you?
No. We are using the website [mtkacodes.tk](http://mtkacodes.tk) for this, but this is the home of the site as we work on it. 

## Can I help?
You can certainly make a pull request if you have any ideas, however we'd prefer that (unless you are a member of the group) you refrain from editing any of the text, because that is custom to the group. 

## When do you plan on finishing the Coder's Unite website?
Sometime soon, as long as it flies along at this pace. We really don't have a formal development schedule. 

## What's the license?
GNU GPL v3. Check out the license info in the repo (creatively titled "LICENSE").
